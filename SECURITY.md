# Reporting security issues

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/brigaccess/score-card-game/security/advisories/new) tab. Or sell them to the vulnerability brokers, this way you'll get something more material than being ignored by a maintainer.
